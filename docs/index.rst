********************
Osyris documentation
********************

Osyris is a python visualization utility for RAMSES data. Its purpose is to
plot quick diagnostics while a simulation is running, and also produce
publication grade figures.

Osyris was developed to provide a light-weight method to read
`RAMSES <https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses>`_ simulation outputs using
``python``.
It currently only works with the native ``binary`` data output format.
It uses ``numpy`` for data manipulation and ``matplotlib`` for visualization.
